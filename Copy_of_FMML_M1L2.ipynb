There are 20640 samples, each with 8 attributes like income of the block, age of the houses per district etc. The task is to predict the cost of the houses per district. We will use the scikit-learn library to load the data and perform some basic data preprocessing and model training. We will also show how to evaluate the model using some common metrics, split the data into training and testing sets, and use cross-validation to get a better estimate of the model's performance."

        "1. Does averaging the validation accuracy across multiple splits give more consistent results?\n",
        "Yes, averaging the validation accuracy across multiple splits typically gives more consistent and reliable results. This is commonly done using k-fold cross-validation or similar techniques, and it addresses the variability that can occur when using a single train-validation split.\n",
        "\n",
        "Here’s why averaging across multiple splits improves consistency:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Reduces Variance Due to Random Splits\n",
        "\n",
        "When you split the data randomly into training and validation sets, one particular split may lead to unusually high or low validation accuracy due to data imbalance or random chance.\n",
        "\n",
        "By averaging results across multiple splits, you smooth out the impact of any \"lucky\" or \"unlucky\" splits.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "2. Better Use of Data\n",
        "\n",
        "In k-fold cross-validation, every data point is used for both training and validation at least once. This ensures no single split dominates the performance estimate, leading to a better generalization estimate.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "3. More Reliable Performance Estimate\n",
        "\n",
        "Averaging across multiple splits provides a more robust estimate of model performance, especially on small or moderately sized datasets where variability can be high.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",

        "---\n",
        "\n",
        "Example: K-Fold Cross-Validation\n",
        "\n",
        "In k-fold cross-validation, the data is split into k subsets (folds). The model is trained on k-1 folds and validated on the remaining fold, repeating this process k times with a different fold used for validation each time.\n",
        "\n",
        "Final validation accuracy = average of all k validation accuracies.\n",
        "\n",
        "\n",
        "This average reduces the risk of overestimating or underestimating performance due to a single split.\n",
        "\n",
        "When Consistency Matters\n",
        "\n",
        "If the dataset is small or noisy, relying on a single validation split can be misleading. Averaging across multiple splits reduces this risk and provides a more consistent assessment of your model's performance.\n",

        "Would you like an example or more details about k-fold cross-validation?\n",
